Townhall for Theory Decadal Survey: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EaLRFVl2U_kyTJDnNyronKlvRBG1MR4GqlxAFhK5GVI/edit?usp=sharing)
	•	University meetings have happened (ANU/Melbourne/etc?)
	•	Summary:
	◦	Australian landscape dominated by big surveys but no theory work done to accompany this
	◦	We’re at risk of having too much data without enough theorists
	◦	We should have a theory focused institute like UToronto’s CITA
	⁃	Potential Simon’s funding? Mark will contact David Spergel and Julianne Dalcanton once done with decadal survey stuff
	◦	Organizing workshops centered around theory in Aus
	◦	Flagship simulation program
	•	Greg says ANITA might not contribute much to the document but the document will help guide ANITA
	•	AAL will be directly influenced by the document but everything else is purely persuasive
	◦	Having concrete plan for AAL is 80% 
	◦	We need concrete plan if you give us X dollars, here’s what we will do with it
	•	Long term software support needed beyond 6 months with ADACS
	•	Can we connect with the theory community and use ANITA as a vessel to do that?

History of ANITA
	•	ANITA founded in the early to mid 2000s because theory community in Aus always undervalued 
	•	This could be a document for the website
	•	Theory dedicated post doc in Australia? 
	•	Is this history worth writing up? This was done for the ASA in recent years
	•	Should we be keeping track of the history and building culture separate from funding?
	•	List of talk winners is here: https://anita.edu.au/meetings.html
	•	Oldest 2014 ANITA email by Greg Poole – 10 years ago they also wanted to pursue prize theory fellowship and institute

Quarterly Newsletter
	•	Awards, funding/fellowship deadlines, papers submitted, little blurbs on research from people
	•	Send to everyone in the ASA who clicked on ANITA
	•	To do (Sabrina/Fiona): Collate the information, adapt web scraper for the arXiv to find papers with ANITA Australian authors 
	•	Aim to have first newsletter out by end of September, 2024

Next next (2026) ANITA 
	•	Discuss next year (2026) ANITA workshop on astrostatistics
	•	Or LISA focused ANITA workshop? 

Short meeting in a month – on the timescale that decadal survey is finalized
