Minutes 2023-05-02

Attendees: Greg Poole, Amanda Karakas, Evgeni Grishin, Thor Tepper Garcia, Sabrina Berger, Ilya Mandel

From last action minutes: we now have minutes available at https://anita.edu.au/Minutes/ .
We also have ANITA reports to ASA and exit surveys from last 3 workshops in the github repo.

Main topic of discussion: next school/workshop (to be held at Monash February 5-9, 2024)

School topics: Dynamics (with few-body and N-body)?  Or TDEs?  The latter could appeal to a broader community (dynamicists and hydro modellers and light curve modellers and observers...), would match previous week's transient workshop held in Melbourne.  Possible speakers: Daniel Price, Adelle Goodwin, Katie Auchettl, maybe even some overseas visitors for transients workshop.

Planning items:
- Rooms reservation (30-40 people for school on M & Tu, like PACE; 80 for workshop, half-day W, Th, half-day F).  ACTION: *Evgeni*
- Website, registration.  ACTION: *Ilya*
- Schedule of workshop: TBD
- Catering (or just send people nearby for coffee?).  ACTION: *Evgeni & Daniel*
- Workshop W or Th dinner restaurant reservation.  ACTION: *Evgeni & Daniel*
